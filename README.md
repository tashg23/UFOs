# UFOs

##project overview: 
to create a webpage that provides an in depth analysis of UFO sightings. Users can filter the UFO sightings data by multiple filters. 

##results: 
- Navigate to: file:///Users/nitashagill/Desktop/Bootcamp/UFOs/index.html

- See above for a screenshot of the webpage 

- Users can filter the UFO sightings table based on 5 different filters: date, city, state, country, shape 
- For example, if the user wants to see all UFO sightings in the city 'el cajon', type in the city name and hit enter

- Based on the above filter, there were 5 UFO sightings in the city of el cajon. 

##summary: 
There are a few potential areas of improvement for the webpage: 
- The data file is static and is not connected to a live database that continually updates with new UFO sightings 
- The 'duration' column could use some cleaning as the data is not all in the same format (e.g. 5 mins vs 5 minutes) 
- There are no filters for duration or comments (e.g. if the user wants to filter by all UFO sightings with red lights)
